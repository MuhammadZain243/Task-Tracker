# Task Tracker CLI

A simple, lightweight **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to track your tasks — what to do, what you're working on, and what you've completed. Built with **Node.js** using only native modules — no dependencies.


## Features

- ✅ Add, update, delete tasks
- 🚧 Mark tasks as `todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`
- 📋 List all tasks or filter by status
- 💾 Saves tasks in a local `tasks.json` file
- ⚙️ No external libraries — uses Node.js core modules only
